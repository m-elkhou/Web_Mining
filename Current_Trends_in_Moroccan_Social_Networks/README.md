# Current Trends in Moroccan Social Networks

## Objectif : 

<p>
Mining social media network (FaceBook, Twitter, etc.) and news websites </br>
for discovering what topics Moroccan people are discussing during the two last years.  

- Use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) or other topic identification techniques.

- Provide a deep analysis.
</p>


## TOOLS AND METHODS

a) Delete unnecessary data: usernames, emails, hyperlinks, retweets, punctuation, possessives from a noun, duplicate characters, and special characters like smileys.

b) Shorten any elongated words (تكبیر → (تكبیییر

c) Normalize whitespace (convert multiple consecutive whitespace characters into one whitespace character).

d) Convert hashtags into separate words, for example; the hashtag #SentimentAnalysis is converted into two words Sentiment and analysis.

e) Create a function to detect the language used to write the text of tweet (Standard Arab, French or English).

f) Create a function for automatic correction of spelling mistakes.

g) Create a list of contractions to normalize and expand words like (What's=>What is)

h) Delete the suffix of a word until we find the root. For example (Stemming => stem) 

i) Remove tokens of part of speech that are not important to our analysis by using the Part-Of-Speech software of Stanford
University. This software reads the text and assigns parts of
speech (noun, verb, adjective) to each word.

j) Remove stopwords of standard Arabic (...,بعد, إن, أن )  French (alors, à, ainsi, ...), and English (about, above, almost,...).

- Topic models: LDA
