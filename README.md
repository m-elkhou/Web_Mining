## TOOLS AND METHODS

- The Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The NLP system is based on five steps:

a) Lexical Analysis: which is concerned with the structure of words; to analyze this structure, the lexical analysis divides a text into phrases, sentences, and words.

b) Syntactic Analysis: is concentrated on the analysis of the sentence structure by analyzing the words and their relationship within this sentence.

c) Semantic Analysis: is interested in the meaning of sentences considered individually.

d) Disclosure Integration: handles the relationship between the current sentence and the sentence just before it, to give a meaning to the current one.

e) Pragmatic Analysis: which determine the meaning of the text in context.

***

a) Delete unnecessary data: usernames, emails, hyperlinks, retweets, punctuation, possessives from a noun, duplicate characters, and special characters like smileys.

b) Shorten any elongated words ( → تكبیر(تكبیر

c) Normalize whitespace (convert multiple consecutive whitespace characters into one whitespace character).

d) Convert hashtags into separate words, for example; the hashtag #SentimentAnalysis is converted into two words Sentiment and analysis.

e) Create a function to detect the language used to write the text of tweet (Standard Arab, French or English).

f) Create a function for automatic correction of spelling mistakes.

g) Create a list of contractions to normalize and expand words like (What's=>What is)

h) Delete the suffix of a word until we find the root. For example (Stemming => stem) 

i) Remove tokens of part of speech that are not important to our analysis by using the Part-Of-Speech software of Stanford
University. This software reads the text and assigns parts of
speech (noun, verb, adjective) to each word.

j) Remove stopwords of standard Arabic ( ,(...,بعد, إن, أن  French (alors, à, ainsi, ...), and English (about, above, almost,...).
