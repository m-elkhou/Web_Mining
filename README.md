## TOOLS AND METHODS

- The Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The NLP system is based on five steps:

a) Lexical Analysis: which is concerned with the structure of words; to analyze this structure, the lexical analysis divides a text into phrases, sentences, and words.
b) Syntactic Analysis: is concentrated on the analysis of the sentence structure by analyzing the words and their relationship within this sentence.
c) Semantic Analysis: is interested in the meaning of sentences considered individually.
d) Disclosure Integration: handles the relationship between the current sentence and the sentence just before it, to give a meaning to the current one.
e) Pragmatic Analysis: which determine the meaning of the text in context.
