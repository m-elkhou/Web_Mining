",56,"an analysis of the applicability of the hypersonic
similarity law to the study of the flow about bodies
of revolution at zero angle of attack .
  the hypersonic similarity law as derived by tsien has been
investigated by comparing the pressure distributions along bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack .  in making
these comparisons, particular
attention was given to determining the limits of mach number and fineness
ratio for which the similarity law applies .  for the purpose of this
investigation, pressure distributions
determined by the method of
characteristics for ogive cylinders for
values of mach numbers and fineness
ratios varying from 1.5 to 12 were compared .
pressures on various cones
and on cone cylinders were also compared in this study .
  the pressure distributions presented demonstrate that the hypersonic
similarity law is applicable over a
wider range of values of mach numbers
and fineness ratios than might be expected from the assumptions made in
the derivation .  this is significant since within the range of
applicability of the law a single pressure
distribution exists for all similarly
shaped bodies for which the ratio of
free-stream mach number to fineness
ratio is constant .  charts are presented
for rapid determination of
pressure distributions over ogive cylinders for any combination of mach
number and fineness ratio within defined limits .

in the range .  these are obtained by
making nondimensional the appropriate governing equations of

",100,"vibration isolation of aircraft power plants .
vibration in aircraft structure can almost
always be traced to vibratory forces originating
from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted
to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air
forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent
to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct
transmission of unbalanced forces from the power
plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has
always caused the preponderance of disturbance .
vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting
structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the
associated parts, and always shorten the useful life
of the entire aircraft structure .  more important,
however, are the psychological and physiological
effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise
on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely
be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so
intimately associated with flying .  the importance
and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can
hardly be questioned .
  this paper is limited to a consideration of the
directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the
power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means
to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body
of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case
of engines and engine supporting structures having
axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods
employed could easily be extended to other cases .

aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

",185,"some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in
aerodynamic research .
a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in
compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air .
most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic,
chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of
specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based
on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a
suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas
mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is
nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and
comprised of commercially available components .
calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs
comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of
three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given
mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture
wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be
appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a
corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages
can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research .
the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and
proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at
flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel
temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the
relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with
temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall
within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer
research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl
number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .

",575,"atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle .
the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is
 considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved
numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of
different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that
deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the
rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once
such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the
dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is
expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section .
 an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of
sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the
problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of
 conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted,
then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working
sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an
optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from
equilibrium .
it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected
 by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed
slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated
 to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing
occurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more
sensitive to departures from equilibrium .

  analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate
processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy
levels .  exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the
inverse method for inviscid airflow over a near-spherical nose
under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails
through the nose region .  typical conditions considered include
nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and
velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec .
  the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling
among the reactions considered .  these included
dissociation-recombination, bimolecular-exchange, and ionization reactions .
the exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions
to be important in blunt-nose flow for the kinetics of no and n,
as they are in the case of a plane shock wave .  an important
difference between blunt-nose flow and plane shock flow,
however, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the
former .  this expansion reduces post-shock reaction rates .  as a
consequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogen-atom
concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below
those for infinite-rate equilibrium .  the reduction below the
equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for
nitrogen dissociation at higher velocities .
  in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated
by two-body collision processes .  the inviscid nose flow,
including coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to
binary scaling for a given velocity .  the binary scaling is
demonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the
exact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of
ambient density and nose radius .  this similitude, which can
also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the
shock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing
where it is applicable .

turbulent shear stresses given by the mean products of velocity
fluctuations and the derivatives of the mean velocities, i.e. the measured mean
velocity gradients .  in this sort of investigations the conception of
the /correlation/ is of paramount importance .  the late a. friedman
tried to introduce the correlations as unknown variables in the
hydrodynamic equations., however, he could not carry his investigations to
practical results, i.e., to results which can be compared with the

region consists of decaying isotropic turbulence .
it is assumed that the reynolds number
of the turbulence is large, and that the mach number is small .
  the noise appears to be generated mainly
by those eddies of the turbulence whose
contribution to the rate of dissipation of kinetic
energy by viscosity is negligible .
  it is shown that the intensity of sound at large

as that due to a volume distribution of simple acoustic
sources occupying the turbulent region .
in this analogy, the whole fluid is to be regarded
as a stationary and uniform acoustic
medium .  the local value of the acoustic power output
p per mass of turbulent fluid is given
approximately by the formula
where a is a numerical constant, u is the

c is the velocity of sound in the fluid .  the
constant a is expressed in terms of the well-known

review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surface .
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this point .
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separation .
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .

  experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer

of the forebody .
  tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a

interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat
wider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are
presented and compared with each other in terms of

forebody .
  the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be
roughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody,
the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody
end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or
reynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds

from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and
some quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number
range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit

concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated
boundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient

observed .

body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .
  in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion
angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing
test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach
number square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the
effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually
constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody
heat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the

",846,"on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal
pressure .
  the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled
circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered .
it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure
has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics .
for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to
diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency
is in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number of
circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated
with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p .
if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p
when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest
frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal
pressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequency
spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the
frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential
nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal
pressure .
  experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration
modes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinders
subjected to internal pressure are briefly described .  these
results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's
  the effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfect
circular symmetry is discussed .

flow and heat transfer in channels with transverse

  combined free and forced convective heat
transfer in vertical channels has been studied by many
researchers .  due to the need for engineering design
information there have been many papers concerning
cases of fully developed flow with varying wall
temperature .  forced flows in a channel of electrically
conducting fluid with a transverse magnetic field
have been studied and the large effects of a magnetic
field on the flow pattern have been established .
  flows of combined free and forced convection in
electrically conducting fluids in vertical channels
with a transverse magnetic field are expected to
attract attention in future engineering applications, for
example, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or in
plasma studies .  however, except for a report by
gershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning a
particular case, no general study has been published .
  this paper is a general treatment of fully
developed, free and forced convective, laminar,
magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with a
transverse magnetic field .  it includes combined free and
forced convective flows in channels without a
magnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. as
special cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in the

effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces .
an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,
and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several
limitations on such streams .
in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force
liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure
gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in
the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same
boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which
agrees closely with machine calculations .
in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due
 to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be
negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are
separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature
variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional
heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the
constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for
free-convection flows/ considered by many authors .
finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise
variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the
independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise
velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the
channel, a solution is given .

solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or
straight leading and trailing edges . moreover, it is directly
applicable to control surfaces such as all-movable tails but modifications
are needed to apply it to controls in general . applications of the
method involve evaluations of numerous integrals that must be handled by
 numerical procedures but systematic schemes of evaluations have been
adopted that are well suited to the routines of automatic digital
computing machines . these schemes of evaluation have been incorporated in
a program for an ibm 704 electronic data processing machine . with this
machine, a pressure distribution together with such quantities as
section or total lift and moment coefficients or generalized forces can be
determined for a given value of frequency and mach number and for
several /four or five/ modes of oscillation in about 4 minutes of

boundary layer .
  it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes in
heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two
conceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat
transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain
distance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocity
and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance
determines the position of the propagating flame .  in the second
mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a
continuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot
recirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous
ignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is the
characteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines
the position of the flame .
  all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with
conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable .
in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show
under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides
the appropriate model and also how the two models are related .
to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to
study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over a
wall heated in the form of a step function .  with a turbulent
boundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., the
characteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproducible
variable .  these observations led to the conclusion that a
continuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated
turbulent boundary layers .  a rational explanation is made for the
transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable
in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar
boundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated
turbulent boundary layers .

an apparent ignition energy was found .  the logarithm of the heat
added at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear function
of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature .  the activation

",798,"interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important
effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been
written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surface .
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this point .
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separation .
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .

  this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in
the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying
reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of
revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  the
effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions
and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is
also included .
  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .
the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x
diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .
  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects
were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the
normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow
reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical
approximations .
  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the
incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good
agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the
body .
  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the
pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a
mach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause a
small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .

quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain

  the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a

nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of
some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic
re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor
of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the

for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight
state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive
under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the
employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .
  investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the
conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat,
and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small
thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high
radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature
profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across
the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that
for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed
glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is
the only material parameter affecting this thickness .
  a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the
surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although,
these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the
overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely
low viscosity level .

to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said
to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,
as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to
decrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed .
for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar
velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),
in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed to
reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  the
disturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or the
longitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizing
influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the
velocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of fales
rotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the deceleration .
at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the
stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further
shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration .
even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral
stability may not be used without reservation .  to calculate

solid flat plate preceded by a porous
section that is transpiration cooled .
the analysis is restricted to a prandtl
number of unity and linear
variation of viscosity with temperature .
  the local skin friction has been
found to have a low value in the
region of transpiration cooling and then
to increase until it approaches

as half of the ultimate increase

",140,"the determination of turbulent skin friction by means
of pitot tubes .
  a simple method of determining
local turbulent skin friction on a smooth
surface has been developed which utilises a
round pitot tube resting on the surface .
assuming the existence of a region near the
surface in which conditions are functions
only of the skin friction, the relevant physical
constants of the fluid and a suitable length,
a universal non-dimensional relation is
obtained for the difference between the total
pressure recorded by the tube and the static
pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin
friction .  this relation, on this assumption,
is independent of the pressure gradient .
the truth and form of the relation were first
established, to a considerable degree of
accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically
similar round pitot tubes--the diameter
being taken as representative length .  these four
pitot tubes were then used to determine
the local skin friction coefficient at three stations
on a wind tunnel wall, under varying
conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station,
within the limits of experimental
accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was
found to be the same for each pitot
tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and
leaving little doubt as to the correctness
of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses
were then made in the pipe and in the
boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results
were plotted in two non-dimensional
forms on the basis already suggested and they
fell close together in a region whose
outer limit represented the breakdown of the
basic assumption, but close to the wall
the results spread out, due to the unknown
displacement of the effective centre of a
pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides
further evidence of the existence of a
region of local dynamical similarity and of the
correctness of the skin friction deduced
from measurements with round pitot tubes on
the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the
region in which the local dynamical similarity
may be expected to hold appears to vary
from about to of the boundary-layer
thickness for conditions remote from,
and close to, separation respectively .

atmosphere .
a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic
theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for
steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution
was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily
extended to bodies of arbitrary shape .
it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of
solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of
negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to
steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar
radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly
important as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150
miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that
determines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar
radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of
nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures .
in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the
angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should
be kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice
by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at
small angles of attack .
it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring
thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive
and negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface
as possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically,
this may be accomplished by boattailing the body .
in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is
shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of
magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally
by emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural
radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures .
it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide
range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity
of the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is
based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent
of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy .
a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by
the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in
thermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be
used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation
coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .

",902,"some current and proposed investigations into the flow
for slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion .
  the practical need for research
into the aerodynamics of
slender delta wings in unsteady motion has
been emphasized in a recent
paper by zbrozek .  two important aspects
are ..  -      formation and presence of
      leading-edge vortices .
      with oscillatory or transient
      modes of longitudinal (or
      chordwise) bending .
  the first of the aspects
above, has already been briefly
discussed in ref. 2 .  one feature of
the flow with leading-edge vortices
which seems to be of particular
significance to the dynamic behaviour
of a wing is the shedding of vorticity
at the leading edge as well as at
the trailing edge .  any time-dependent
motion, or distortion, of the wing
leads to a change in the rate at which
vorticity is shed .  with more
conventional types of flow, the free
vorticity being shed only from the
trailing edge has diminishing influence
on the wing, but when the free
vorticity is shed from the leading edge,
in passing downstream, it
remains close to the upper surface of the
wing .  it might be expected
then, that, although the magnitudes of the
unsteady forces may not be
greatly affected for a slender delta, the
time delays associated with
the forces may be significantly different
for the attached and
separated regimes of leading-edge flow .

numbers of 6. 8 and 9. 6.
  measurements are presented for pressure
gradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on a
flat plate in air at a mach number of 9.6 and for the
drag of thin wings at a mach number of about 6.8
and zero angle of attack .  the pressure
measurements at a mach number of 9.6 were made in the
presence of substantial heat transfer from the
boundary layer to the plate surface .  the measured
pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was
predicted with good accuracy by a modification to
insulated-plate displacement theory which allows
for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature
gradient along the surface on the boundary-layer
displacement thickness .
  the total drag of thin wings with square and delta
plan forms was measured at a nominal mach number
of 6.8 over a reasonably wide range of reynolds
numbers .  the total drag was found to be greater
than can be explained by adding a classical value of
laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag .
the difference is, in general, explained by the
increase in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by
the boundary-layer-induced pressures .

  the stability of a compressed elastic
ring has been studied by a method which
can be extended to solve the problem
of the stability of a flexible heavy structure
spread by a system of hoops as in a crinoline
skirt .  the original work by levy, which
was developed by timoshenko and love,
cannot be generalized to problems in
which the compressing forces are affected by
the deformation of the ring .
  it is shown that the load at which a ring
will buckle depends not only upon the
magnitude of the load but also upon its first
derivative relative to the radial distance .
a positive derivative causes the ring to
buckle at a higher load .  when this result
is applied to a cone of heavy and loosely
draped fabric spread by a rigid hoop of
radius and a larger and flexible hoop
of radius below it, both hoops being in
horizontal planes, then various modes
of buckling other than oval are possible
according to the relative magnitudes of
and .  it is found that oval buckling
changes to three-wave buckling when
three-wave changes to
four-wave when, and as and
approach nearer to equality the buckled
form progressively changes to more waves .
when applied to a structure spread by
many horizontal hoops of which the top
one is rigid and oval, it is found that all
other hoops, if each is designed to the
criterion, will have the same
absolute deviation from circularity as the
rigid hoop .  if any one hoop is designed
so that, then the oval shape of

edge of a delta wing and to minimize the lift-dependent drag at sonic

in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thin
delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed
 there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached
flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift
coefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given
in terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding
 to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speeds
load distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and
 the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized
theory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with
 respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load
distributions . it is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these
conically cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached
flow/in which leading edge suction occurs/past the uncambered wing at
the same mach number, as more terms are included in the linear
combination . however, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable
reduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wing
shapes are calculated and drawn . the optimum shapes for a fixed number
of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so
that the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributed
force on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar
magnitude .

  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most
applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several
approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of
these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the
assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .
another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the
shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .
recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .
numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these

of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending
stresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the

the static pressure and velocity in an undisturbed flow at the position
of the tube .
the values of c for a blunt-nosed tube are found to be less than those
for tubes with hemispheroidal heads, but always greater than unity in
the range considered . the effect of the orifice size is to decrease c
as the orifice size increases, this decrease is very small but increases

pressure distribution measurements and drag determination by means of
balance measurements have been carried out for a number of models at

walls has been varied . within the investigated range it appeared that a
 thickening of the boundary layer reduced the disturbing influence of

in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national
physical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum,
 in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects
experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the
risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .
this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working
sections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect
corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height
normally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open
area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant
proportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number

effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from
those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more
 generally until these trends have been checked by further
investigations .

",1244,"on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet .
  a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum
noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent
jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the /
quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound-
emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher
than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an
irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were
frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar
shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it .
  the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent
the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer .
acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as
transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/
or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is
visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of
geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in
transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic
waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in
ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at
speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium .
however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise
of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the
fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to
lighthill .
  those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect
to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer
are significantly modified by the viscous action through the
critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective
amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it .
kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream
emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation
significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power
output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions
augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as,
predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective
corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per
unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted
downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating
the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may
increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing
action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be
interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of
the shear-layer profiles .

the other is of varying cross-sectional area .  it is assumed that
the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initially
a uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations)
of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered .
when the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed,
the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is
nonisentropic .  in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the
area variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are
two further contributions--viz., a permanent perturbation
caused directly by the area changes and a transient
disturbance--which propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow
behind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent
perturbation at the shock .  expressions for these various contributions are

  the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake

extremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total

this region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimental

the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical

was the mach number .  at the highest mach number

gas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range .  three
optical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation ..
which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in the
range is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg .
which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 and
ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the
pressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm
hg for argon .

field .  above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation
from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear

shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical,
radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic
effects .  this conclusion is supported by other experiments based

  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10
corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid
wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed
body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion
and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed
by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from
the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the
surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows
enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer
inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it
behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/
wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial
value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of
the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight
velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the
turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar
turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements
of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the
region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .
tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the
wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed
case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .
  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as
electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the
two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure
diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for
m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the
case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent
radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300
mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for
uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the
width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma
requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body
diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .
these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider
including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion
recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete
picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .

  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a

entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties and a distance along the body
surface from the stagnation point) .
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds

  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and
roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .
transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on
the model surface .
  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a
hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the
entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties and a distance along the body
surface from the stagnation point) .
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds
number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the
hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .

",315,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds
and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .
  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic
speeds arise from differences between the conditions
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in
how they behave after separation .  for turbulent
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly
as the reynolds number is changed and in many
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed
artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by
excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever
possible .
  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,
and the results obtained by using them are compared .
in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement
is found, and explanations can be advanced for
cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed
and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed
in interpreting the results obtained with transition
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner
wings) .
  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds
number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may
separate from very close to the leading edge .  under
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .
more research is needed before sound recommendations
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .
  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition
may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition
have been satisfactory .

  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10
corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid
wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed
body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion
and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed
by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from
the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the
surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows
enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer
inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it
behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/
wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial
value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of
the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight
velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the
turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar
turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements
of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the
region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .
tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the
wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed
case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .
  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as
electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the
two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure
diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for
m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the
case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent
radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300
mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for
uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the
width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma
requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body
diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .
these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider
including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion
recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete
picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .

  a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for
predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing
and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender
configurations at subsonic speeds .  the wing trailing-vortex wake is
represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the
spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the
exposed wing panels .  the afterbody is represented by corresponding
image vortices within the body .  two-dimensional line-vortex theory is
then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the
resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a
numerical stepwise integration procedure .  the method was applied to the
calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of
downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and
cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of
such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and
incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on
the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied .
the relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image
vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total
downwash was assessed at a possible tail location .
  it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted
the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations
with reasonable facility and accuracy .  a calculated sample wake shape
agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample
results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact
crossflow-plane solution .  an empirical formula was derived to estimate
the number  of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory
computation of downwash at tail locations .  it was found that the shape
of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind
a wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing
edge .  for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations
considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is
largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing
vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by
the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .

",927,"investigation of normal force distributions and wake
vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic
speeds .
  the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies
of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in
order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex
wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing
interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal
force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local
flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are
discussed and analyzed .
  comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and
center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with
theories which include methods for estimating the effects of
viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly
dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack .
further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and
experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that,
in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing
theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and
distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .
  the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the
circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body
vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter
integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet .
the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in
close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength
formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is
assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical
portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible
potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of
equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however,
in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex
locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined
from experiment .
  the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are,
in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned
incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination
angles which are in good agreement with the measured values,
except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,
and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are
expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple
methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to
substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and
experiment .
  it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be
adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions
represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the
distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are
accurately known .

  the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces of a

theory .  the system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and,
in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect to

",1277,"a study of vortex cancellation .
  the cancellation of a vortex by means of another concentric
vortex of equal strength but opposite spin is investigated .  when
such a cancellation occurs, there is a recovery of static pressure .
the vortices are generated by means of two three-dimensional
airfoils cantilevered from the duct wall, one being situated in the
wake of the other .  the airfoils have opposite effective angles of
attack and therefore have trailing vortices of opposite spin, as
required .
  it is demonstrated experimentally that there exists an optimum
angle of attack for the second airfoil which cancels the vortex
from the first airfoil and restores uniform flow downstream of
the two airfoils .  a theoretical solution of this optimum angle of
attack is presented, and it is found to depend upon the angle of
attack of the first airfoil and upon the geometrical properties of
the wings .  the pressure recovery accompanying the vortex
cancellation is also studied .  theoretical considerations, based on
the model of a vortex filament in the center of a circular tube
show that a maximum of 62 per cent of the static pressure drop
across the first airfoil can be recovered .  this maximum is
imposed, irrespective of skin friction and separation losses, by the
irreversibility associated with establishing a vortex field .
experimental pressure recoveries of 50 per cent are realized .
  perhaps the primary value of the present study is the
opportunity it provides to verify certain of the fundamental concepts
of fluid mechanics which are brought into play when the trailing

tunnel of the effects of leading-edge modifications on the flow and
forces on an untapered wing of 50 deg leading-edge sweep, at stream mach
 numbers between 0 60 and 1 20 . seven leading-edge profiles were
tested, ranging from a drooped extension of 18 per cent of the chord of
the basic sharp-nosed section to a round-nosed section with a
leading-edge radius of 1 0 per cent of the basic chord .
leading-edge droop was found to increase the wing drag near zero lift
but to reduce appreciably the lift-dependent drag component, except at
the highest test mach numbers . droop also increased the lift
coefficient at which leading-edge separation occurred on the upper surface
at moderate subsonic speeds, but in addition reduced the mach number for
 transonic flow attachment . the appearance of the forward shock /but
not the rear shock/ is considerably delayed when the leading edge is
drooped .
with the undrooped sections an increase in leading-edge radius was
accompanied by successively earlier appearances of the forward shock,
and hence the outboard shock with its attendant separation . the
conditions at which the rear shock first appeared changed only slowly as the
section was changed .
the variations in wing flow pattern as the leading edge is modified are
discussed and related to measured changes in the wing lift and drag .

in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at

the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of
steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp
leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal
shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large
region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave
very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly
curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the
boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,
and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave
larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,
and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the
framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave
influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt
leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against
the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental
data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this
parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the

in mixtures of two different gases or liquids, one constituent

discovered as early as 1856 and 1873 respectively .  the two

mass and heat, or as a coupling between heat and mass transfer .
the effects of this coupling have been neglected in all

publication however, it was shown that they can be large in
laminar-boundary-layer-type flows with helium injection .

there is, at present, considerable interest in the
characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a

contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but
there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from
mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in

the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes
are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a
total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting
may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape
may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat-

",798,"interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important
effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been
written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surface .
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this point .
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separation .
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .

aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamic
heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . data
obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced
cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the
hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range . tests made at a
mach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments
 of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature
can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders
with only a slight increase in the stagnation rate . the total heat
transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than
the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders .
comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions
showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by
available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/
reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves
 open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where
they usually differ .

of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnation
point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at
creased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreased

preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibility

  the paper presents a mathematical discussion of the
laminar boundary layer, which was developed with a view
of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers
in particular for which the phenomenon of separation
occurs .  the treatment starts with a slight modification of
the form of the boundary layer equation first published by
von mises .  two approximate solutions of this equation
are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the
boundary layer while the other is exact at the wall .  the
final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions
at the inflection points of the velocity profiles .  the final
solution is given in terms of a series of universal functions
for a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributions
outside of the boundary layer .  detailed calculations of
the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the
case in which the potential velocity is a linear function of
the distance from the upstream stagnation point .  finally
the complete separation point characteristics are
determined for the boundary layer associated with a potential
velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of
the distance from the stagnation point .  it appears that
extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex
potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using
the explicit formulae given in the paper .

",459,"on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .
  the theory of the laminar boundary layer
offers a means of determining the skin friction
under the assumption of a given velocity
distribution outside the boundary layer .  owing to the
mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions
are possible only when the velocity distribution
is expressed as a simple function of the distance
along the surface .  more complicated velocity
distributions necessitate recourse to the method of
expansion in series or that of step-by-step
calculations, but the labor involved is too great for the
methods to be of practical use .  approximate
method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long
been recommended for general use, gives a
reasonably accurate solution in a region of accelerated
flow, but recently its adequacy in a region of
retarded flow has been questioned .  separation of
flow may actually occur where the solution of
pohlhausen fails to give it .  more recently howarth
solution, which gives fairly reasonable results in
a region of retarded flow .
  howarth's solution essentially consists in
solving the boundary layer equations for the particular
case in which the velocity u outside the boundary
layer decreases linearly with the distance x
measured along the surface, and utilizing the solution
by replacing the actual distribution of u by a
circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides .
therefore, it is assumed that the velocity
distribution at any section depends on the velocity
gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected
by the conditions upstream only in so far as this
affects the momentum thickness 0 .  in other words,
the velocity distribution across the boundary layer
is determined by a parameter .

cross-section . when the time t is small, the first approximation gives a

from 3,000 to 25,000 .  the measured pressure distributions were

discussed .  it is shown that an increase in the initial deviation
from flatness or a static pressure differential across the plate
raises the critical value of the /reduced velocity ./
  the applicability of the galerkin method to the linearized
problem of flutter of an unbuckled plate has been questioned by
several authors .  in this paper the flutter condition was
formulated in the form of an integral equation and solved numerically
by the method of iteration and the method of matrix
approximations, thus avoiding the constraint of assumed modes .  for a
plate (with finite bending rigidity) the results confirm those
given by the galerkin method .
  an approximate analysis of the limiting form and amplitude of
the flutter motion for a buckled plate is presented .

",908,"random vibration .
  random vibration is vibration which results
from an excitation which is not well represented by any simple
function (sinusoid, step, etc.) or any simple combination of
such functions but which is satisfactorily modeled by a
stochastic process .  it is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration
to say that /all vibration is random vibration ./  every
vibration record contains /hash/ at some level .  nevertheless,
until recently, engineering vibration theory has been able to
get along without including the consideration of random
excitations .
  now in several fields simultaneously there has occurred a
burst of activity in the application of random processes .  the
response of aircraft to buffeting from atmospheric turbulence
and the response of ships to confused seas have been put on
reasonably firm footing .  possibly the most dramatic problems
have been posed by the development of large jet and rocket
engines which produce spectacular amounts of random
vibrational energy .  the high level of random vibration in a jet
plane or a missile provides a severe environment with respect
to fatigue failure of structural members and with respect to
malfunctions of sensitive equipment .

for small reynolds numbers .

presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions
are, respectively, of the forms
where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made
dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds
number, and and vanish with r .  substitution
of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a
set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but
only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each
expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and
the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that
unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the
fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from
the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which
yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus
possible to determine alternately successive terms in each
expansion .

stationary as the free-stream mach number
was increased to 3.8, this

believed representative of all

  in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows
it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for
example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip,

to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling
on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this
upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with
optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes,

  in this paper a method for investigating the insulating

dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical
situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the
heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is
completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the
temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction
from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer
established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream
surface .
  the karman integral method extended to both the momentum
and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer
has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection
ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions
and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum,
and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous
by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity

stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree
polynomials .  the resulting two integral-differential equations
are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along

boundary layer has been carried out for the pressure
distribution for an elliptic cylinder of axial ratio 2.96 ..  1 with
its major axis in the direction of the incident stream .
the solution has been obtained by the method of hartree and
womersley .  in applying this method the derivatives
parallel to the boundary are replaced by finite differences, so
that the partial differential equation of the boundary
layer is replaced by an ordinary equation relating the velocity
distribution through the boundary layer at one section
to that at another, at an interval upstream .  by two independent
integrations covering the same range by finite intervals
of different sizes, it is possible to estimate the errors
involved in replacing the derivatives by finite differences,
and so to correct for these errors .
  the process of solution requires the values of the pressure
gradient along the solid boundary, and there is a certain
tolerance in the derivation of the pressure gradient distribution
from a limited number of observed values of pressure .
an analysis of schubauer's pressure distribution is outlined, and
the results were used for the main solution calculated .
it is found that the solution, for the distribution of pressure gradient
so derived, does not give separation of the boundary
layer from the solid boundary, whereas the actual flow does separate .
  it is found that the calculated solution is very sensitive to
the pressure distribution, and a comparatively small
modification of the pressure distribution gives a solution which
does indicate separation close to the point at which
separation is observed to occur .  the solution with this pressure
distribution also gives very good agreement with the
observed velocity distribution through the boundary layer at
points upstream from separation .

",315,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds
and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .
  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic
speeds arise from differences between the conditions
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in
how they behave after separation .  for turbulent
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly
as the reynolds number is changed and in many
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed
artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by
excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever
possible .
  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,
and the results obtained by using them are compared .
in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement
is found, and explanations can be advanced for
cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed
and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed
in interpreting the results obtained with transition
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner
wings) .
  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds
number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may
separate from very close to the leading edge .  under
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .
more research is needed before sound recommendations
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .
  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition
may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition

two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies
are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large

the interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending

to account for bluntness . in the boundary layer, the approximate
solution is found to be governed by a local flat-plate similarity . under

unity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body . for flat-plate

  when a hypersonic object enters earth's atmosphere, a shock
wave is formed in front of it, and the air passing through this

to achieve equilibrium, it is necessary to excite vibration,

by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits
of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the

inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge
slender bodies are made .  the investigations are generalized to
consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free

with the flow field about a model in the test section of a
hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free

  inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and
sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometries .  the
results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in
inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy),
is considerably diminished for this model .  this conclusion is

calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will
occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range
of values . they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun the
gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will
remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it

 an order of magnitude and the usual reduction in frozen boundary layer
heat transfer due to a highly-cooled noncatalytic surface can increase
from stall of adjacent stages .

operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that
such compromises would severely reduce the complete-compressor-stall

from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible

the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance

",329,"various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied
gas flow .
  this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous
aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and
at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free
path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer
theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .
  results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to
define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of
continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental
evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a
model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this
model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in
detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a
reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .
  in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes
of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/
class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction .
for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the
shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully
viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer
are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the
navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given
by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer
class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes
equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock
structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary
conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/
conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an
infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened
sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this
case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying
conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses,
and heat conduction .
  for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes
equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for
both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions
of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow
problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to
illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations
have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the
assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful
approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged
layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere
using the incipient merged layer approximation .
  results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear,
and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled
sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds
number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above
the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer
regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime .
as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged
regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static
and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .
  calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with
decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime,
the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy
behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they
are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the
stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .
  for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the
same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase
found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated
boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction
theory .

data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and

approximation that, on a slightly curved surface, throughout the layer
is negligibly small .  the additional assumption that the inviscid flow
is irrotational leads to the requirement that is zero at the outer edge
of the boundary layer .  in this theory any interaction between the two

axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into

high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat
increased mass flows, were apparently possible with
compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their
blading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has been
reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient
supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound .
the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the
essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow
compressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies,
large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which
extend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade
is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely
eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no
reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient
is apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the
compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as
to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is
proposed .

possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of
the encouraging results of this study, an experimental
single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in

the tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common
assumption by most of the people working in this field .
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an

to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the

many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this

this distribution will not normally occur when the

nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the

measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any
possible application .  it was concluded that if a useful compressor is
to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to

thus a new approach is necessary .

",588,"compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled .
an analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio
ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means of a
simplified stage-stacking study .  the principal problems considered
were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance
characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor
surge or stall-limit characteristics . the analysis indicated that all
these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance
characteristics of the front stages . such discontinuities can be due
to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance
resulting from stall of adjacent stages .
  the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed
operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that such
compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin .
furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the
inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to
abrupt-stall characteristics .
  the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance
characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to
part-speed compressor performance . these characteristics must, however,
be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the
multistage compressor . alleviation of part-speed operation problems may
also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage-
loading margin .
  the results of this analysis are only qualitative . the trends
obtained, however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental
studies of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and
the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the

discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and

stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady
compressible flow .
  a method is developed for the
calculation of the pressure
distribution and the aerodynamic forces and
moments on a wing performing harmonic
pitching and heaving oscillations .
the calculation is based on the
assumption of inviscid potential flow
without shock waves and is
restricted to small incidence, so that the
linearized theory is valid .
  in contrast to other work in the
field the theory applies to all
mach numbers .  it is restricted to small
values of the reduced frequency
and should be valid for the usual range
of short periods occurring at
present in flight .  the formal solution
yields two integral equations for
the parts of the load, which are in phase
and go out of phase with the
oscillation,. these are of the same form
as the corresponding equation
in steady flow .
  the way is thus opened for solutions
over the whole mach number
range at small frequencies, if the
corresponding steady solutions can
be found .  the calculation is in fact
easiest for m = 1 and has been
done here for delta-wings to supplement
a previous supersonic calculation,
made on different frequency assumptions,
which broke down near m = 1 .
it appears from the two sets of results
that the short period oscillation
will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex
angle of the delta wing is
greater than about 60 .  this confirms a
now generally recognised trend .
  such results near m = 1 must of
course be invalidated to an
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and
shock waves at their maximum
effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that
these factors will remove
the critical nature of the transonic damping
as calculated by this method .

when extended to other
planforms, should provide a useful tool in

in the high-speed research on two-dimensional aerofoils at the national
physical laboratory the need to keep model size above a certain minimum,
 in order to reproduce correctly the boundary layer separation effects
experienced at full scale, has been considered paramount even at the
risk of incurring significant tunnel interference effects .
this report discusses the interference effects for the slotted working
sections now in use . the magnitudes of the blockage and lift effect
corrections are deduced for the ratio of model chord to tunnel height
normally used . it is shown that a simple adaptation to reduce the open
area of the walls would reduce both corrections to insignificant
proportions simultaneously, but would give a reduced choking mach number
separated flows . the observed trends in the variation of the blockage
effects for other ratios of model chord to tunnel height differ from
those predicted theoretically, and so the results cannot be applied more
 generally until these trends have been checked by further
investigations .
it is suggested that wake interference effects can significantly

that at the stagnation point the equations can be reduced exactly

not in thermochemical equilibrium .
  two methods of numerical solution of these stagnation point
equations are presented, one for the equilibrium case and the
other for the nonequilibrium case .  numerical results are
correlated in terms of the parameters entering the numerical
formulation so as not to depend critically on the physical assumptions

considered .  a solution is represented which shows the transition
from the /frozen/ boundary layer (very slow recombination
rates) to the equilibrium boundary layer (fast recombination rates) .

involved in relating the equilibrium state of a boundary layer on
bodies of different sizes .

  the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare
configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion
smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body
and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .
  the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over

based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to

temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .
  the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat
transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the
transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder
and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion
of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only
qualitatively correct, and underestimate the heating rate by a factor as

very rapidly .  by making a smooth transition between the

  boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a
sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow .  it is
shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial
distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall
temperature by an angle of 30 to 45 .  this leads to the
conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the
temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer
coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept .
the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the
temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion .  the distortion
is measured by the peclet number .  approximate equations
representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis
and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined
with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength .  a
solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity
profile which is not a straight line .  the use of previously developed
variational principles for the evaluation of convective heat
transfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow,
turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed .

heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow .
  laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been
measured by means of the shrouded model technique .  the
reynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpy
ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5 .
two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model
which consisted of a spherically capped cone .
  the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic
boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the
conical portion of the model .  on the spherical portion the data
are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical
prediction .  some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to
the nose of the model .
  the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared
to two theories ..  (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is
based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account
the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate
reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/
conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with
the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more
accurate .
  for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily
modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional
heat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to
estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat
transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .

",272,"oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic
hypersonic strip theory .
  the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for
conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the
shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled
boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .
  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on
optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder
models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and
roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .
transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on
the model surface .
  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic
feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a
hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the
entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that
transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition
reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer
edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the
sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition
occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder
model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds
number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .
  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical
portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an
extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled
hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition
reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of
the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition
reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the
results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer
cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with
a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-
to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition
reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-
layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred
at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000
based on local external properties and a distance along the body
surface from the stagnation point) .
  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to
be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the
reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the
transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer
cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds
number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the
hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with
an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant
for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .

",315,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds
and methods for fixing transition in model experiments .
  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic
speeds arise from differences between the conditions
under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in
how they behave after separation .  for turbulent
boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly
as the reynolds number is changed and in many
examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent
layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number
and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed
artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel
tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be
minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by
introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by
excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the
effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than
for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered
at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever
possible .
  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,
and the results obtained by using them are compared .
in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement
is found, and explanations can be advanced for
cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and
difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed
and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed
in interpreting the results obtained with transition
fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10
based on local chord for wings of about 0.1
thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner
wings) .
  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased
for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are
swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds
number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range
of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may
separate from very close to the leading edge .  under
these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the
excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and
high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .
more research is needed before sound recommendations
can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed
on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is
often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .
  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples
are given of the spurious results that have been avoided
successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even
at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition
may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead
of the shock, and of the conditions under which there
are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition
have been satisfactory .

pressure gradient on the body are investigated .  the experimental
results are compared with the theories available in the literature .
  the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare
configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion
smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body
and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .
  the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over
a range of reynolds number from 0.3 x 10 to 1.6 x 10 per inch
based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to
the test with liquid nitrogen .  the stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .
  the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat
transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the
transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder
and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion
of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only
qualitatively correct, and underestimate the heating rate by a factor as
high as 3 .  conversely, the /flat plate reference enthalpy/

method is then presented .  this method gives good agreement
with the experimental results presented over the entire range of

delayed transition .  by expanding the flow rapidly between the
cone and the cylinder, the transition reynolds number is reached
very rapidly .  by making a smooth transition between the
cylinder and the flare, no separation occurred at the cylindrical flare

uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in low-speed flow .

investigated .  the technique of air injection into the boundary
layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used .
although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers
as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was
not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10

this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a

of a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit . these methods are then

greatly ..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to

 supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km,

literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence
of reynolds number within each regime .
for certain pure laminar separations a theory for calculating
dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic
and supersonic experiments . this theory involves no empirical
information and provides an explanation of why transition
location relative to reattachment is important . a simple analysis
of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external
flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the
pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress
at the beginning of interaction . various experiments substantiate tnis
variation for most test conditions . an incidental
observation is that the stability of a separated laminar mixing
layer increases markedly with an increase in mach number .
the possible significance of this observation is discussed .

of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been
found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a
gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,
and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body .

combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not
appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the
configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower

observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock

equilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  the
sufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shown
to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees
of freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag
the approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,.
that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in
the respective relaxation times before such a maximum might be
observed .  an example calculation for a mach 13 strong shock
wave in oxygen illustrates the appearance of such a maximum of

in an attempt to avoid flow separation at the leading edge of a thin

 there . this is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached
flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift
coefficient . for sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given
in terms of slender wing theory and the load distributions corresponding
 to arbitrary conical camber are calculated . for supersonic speeds
load distributions arising in the slender wing theory are considered and
 the corresponding conical camber distributions are found by linearized
theory . the lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with
 respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load

reduction is predicted . the corresponding load distributions and wing

of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their edges, so
that the localised leading edge suction is replaced by a distributed

",1072,"ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .
  the analytic investigation of laminar combustion
processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional
present some mathematical difficulties .  there are,
however, several examples of two-dimensional flame
propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in
comparison with that in the principal direction of flow .
such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching
by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate,
combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases
the problem may be simplified by employing what is
known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer
approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his
treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it
consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is
small, the variations of flow properties along the direction
of main flow are small in comparison with those in a
direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic
description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present
analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the
laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas
streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible
mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two
streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar
mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is
modified by viscosity, and the temperature and
composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical
reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream
is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with
temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law .
for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature
distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does
the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far
downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear
and what is the detailed process of development .  since
the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition
always takes place at some point of the stream .  however,
when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a
certain value, the distance required for ignition increases
so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a
physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete
development of the laminar flame front is computed using
an approximation similar to the integral technique
introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .

surface of an electrically heated,
cylindrical body of revolution with a
hemispherical nose was determined from

decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at

hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the
junction with the cylindrical
afterbody .  because measurements of the
static pressure distribution over
the hemisphere indicated that the local
flow pattern tended to become
stationary as the free-stream mach number
was increased to 3.8, this
distribution of heat-transfer parameter is
believed representative of all

temperatures less than that of
dissociation .  the local heat-transfer
parameter was independent of reynolds

range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .

distribution about the body .  this
method, applicable to any body of

solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow
problem, and thus evaluates the

arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and

supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading
edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more .

knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are
described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control
methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground
effect on maximum lift .

involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow
and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of
the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static
longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of
 available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments
due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control,
and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional

in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this

",820,"theories of plastic buckling .
  the theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appears
finally to have achieved a satisfactory form, rests upon the
well-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development of
a correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of
plates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established
polyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .
  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond
the elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow
and deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based on
deformation theories are in better agreement with experiment
than those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests in
which a material is compressed into the plastic range and then
subjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better
agreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimate
doubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for
the plastic buckling of plates .
  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a new
theory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the
flow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept of
slip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less
by mathematical, considerations than previous theories .
experimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in
better agreement with the new theory than with either flow or
deformation theories .  the new theory accounts for the apparent
contradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use of
deformation theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .

",1119,"plastic stability theory of thin shells .
  considerable interest is currently centered on the
role of deformation and flow types of plasticity
theories in the solution of stability problems .  for
thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with
classical stability theory appears to yield results which
are in substantially good agreement with test data .
on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear
to require the introduction of initial imperfections in
order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with
tests .
  thus, in view of the current state of development of
plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit
the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation
theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of
thin shells .  although there may be theoretical
objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on
flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results
obtained from this theory .
  in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential
equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant
unequal radii is derived .  this set of three equations
applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any
loading system leading to buckling .  for particular
problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial
compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres
under external pressure, the set of equations can be
reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential
equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial
displacement only .  these donnell-type equations are
used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres
under external pressure and long and moderate length
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  the
limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under
compression or shear, represent the solutions for short
cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .

  a most troublesome paradox has existed for a number of years
with respect to buckling in the plastic range .  theoretical
considerations and all direct experimental evidence show
conclusively that an incremental or flow type of mathematical theory
of plasticity is valid .  however, the results of plastic buckling
tests are well correlated by a simple total or deformation theory
and bear no resemblance to published predictions of incremental
theory .
  the suggestion was made that initial imperfections of shape
or loading might well explain this most peculiar result .
however, subsequent investigations by several authors seem to have
given the impression that excessively large imperfections would
be needed and that the answer would be overly sensitive to the
magnitude of such imperfections .
  it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that extremely
small, and therefore unavoidable, imperfections of shape do
account for the paradox in a simple manner .  the buckling load is
shown to be extremely insensitive to the amount of imperfection .
the example chosen is a simplified version of the long rectangular
plate hinged along one edge and free on the other under
uniform compressive stress at the ends .  this is the equivalent of
the case of the cruciform column, which has been so disturbing
in the past because incremental theory applied to a perfect

to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said
to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances,
as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to
decrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed .
for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar
velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude),
in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed to
reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  the
disturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or the
longitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizing
influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the
velocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of fales

at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the
stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further
shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration .
even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral
stability may not be used without reservation .  to calculate

  plate problems involving free edges have been historically
difficult to solve, particularly when two free edges are adjacent,
resulting in a free corner .  the cantilevered square plate
subjected to a transverse loading is one such problem for which an
exact solution has not been achieved .
  in the present paper results obtained by various approximate
methods are presented for this problem for the case of a uniform
loading .  solutions obtained by the authors using the technique
of point matching and the rayleigh-ritz method are compared
with previously published finite-difference and experimental
results and with bernoulli-euler beam and plane-strain approaches .
numerical results for deflections, slope components, bending and
twisting moments, and transverse distributed shears are presented
for a relatively fine gridwork of points on the plate boundary
and within the interior .  the antielastic curvature is exhibited by
all methods except beam theory .  all methods present the
interesting conclusion that the free edge deflection is greater when
the plate is treated as a plate rather than a beam .

  the present work is concerned with the determination of

into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the
effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing
thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges .
numerical results are presented for the transient temperature
differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first

of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for

elasticity as well as pure
flow .
  the equation derived was used to
obtain the creep bending deflection
of a beam in pure bending and of a column

ratio of the creep deflections
of the beam in pure bending and the
deflections of a corresponding purely

  the results of the analysis of the

showed that the deflections increase
continuously with time and become
infinitely large only when the loading
time is correspondingly large .

by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the

explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic

cause the load necessary to keep the shell in

critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under

equivalent to donnell's equation but has certain advantages in physical
interpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the case
of shells having clamped edges .  the solution of this modified

  this paper is a brief summary of

on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic

combined with the theory of whitham to
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies
and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as
general, method was derived by walkden in
ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the
volume term, has been used extensively to predict
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,
been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.
altitude and the calculations of this paper show
that under those conditions the shock noise of
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,
be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will
dominate for even the small fighter and they will
dominate over most of the altitude range
for large bomber and supersonic transport
aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases
with altitude as which compares to
in the volume case (=pressure at
altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,
wing loading, wing plan shape and
lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating
the shock noise due to combined volume and
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to
configurations with wings located towards the
rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting
volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is
presented from which rapid estimates can be
made of the shock noise of lifting

",1244,"on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet .
  a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum
noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent
jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the /
quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound-
emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher
than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an
irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were
frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar
shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it .
  the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent
the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer .
acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as
transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/
or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is
visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of
geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in
transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic
waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in
ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at
speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium .
however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise
of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the
fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to
lighthill .
  those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect
to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer
are significantly modified by the viscous action through the
critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective
amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it .
kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream
emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation
significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power
output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions
augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as,
predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective
corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per
unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted
downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating
the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may
increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing
action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be
interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of
the shear-layer profiles .

the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue demands a
knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one
hand to metal physics at the other . at the present time the various
aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know
quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made . never-
the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of
construction in noise environments can be used with a limited
amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of
structure . this approach to the problem is adopted in this
lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the
moment . it must be emphasized, however, that although some
progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a
structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life
of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype
strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if
one is to prove the integrity of the design .
     within the structural limits of single skin construction set in
this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no
reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing
board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of
behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical
simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been
possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by
stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib
for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin
intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet .
     the most resonable basis for the future estimation of
fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n
curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the

",739,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

  this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence
relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by
transonic slender-body theory .  the models chosen for this study are a
flat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of
revolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flows
about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the
theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to

approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares
favorably with jones' slender-wing theory .
  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and
at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic
characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use
of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent
body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate
nonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced
that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that
required for the successful application of the transonic area rule .

  several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for

characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 .  the tests
were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds
numbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .
  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed
the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve

to be subject to mach number effects .  spinning a full-skirted body
about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the
pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static
stability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  the

improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds
associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible

 to possible design requirements at hypersonic speeds . these changes in
 planform resulted in increases in lift-curve slope, lift at high angles

stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady
compressible flow .
  a method is developed for the
calculation of the pressure
distribution and the aerodynamic forces and
moments on a wing performing harmonic
pitching and heaving oscillations .
the calculation is based on the
assumption of inviscid potential flow
without shock waves and is
restricted to small incidence, so that the
linearized theory is valid .
  in contrast to other work in the
field the theory applies to all
mach numbers .  it is restricted to small
values of the reduced frequency
and should be valid for the usual range
of short periods occurring at
present in flight .  the formal solution
yields two integral equations for
the parts of the load, which are in phase
and go out of phase with the
oscillation,. these are of the same form
as the corresponding equation
in steady flow .
  the way is thus opened for solutions
over the whole mach number
range at small frequencies, if the
corresponding steady solutions can
be found .  the calculation is in fact
easiest for m = 1 and has been
done here for delta-wings to supplement
a previous supersonic calculation,
made on different frequency assumptions,
which broke down near m = 1 .
it appears from the two sets of results
that the short period oscillation
will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex
angle of the delta wing is
greater than about 60 .  this confirms a
now generally recognised trend .
  such results near m = 1 must of
course be invalidated to an
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and
shock waves at their maximum
effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that
these factors will remove
the critical nature of the transonic damping
as calculated by this method .
with all its obvious limitations this method,
when extended to other
planforms, should provide a useful tool in
studying the effect of
geometrical parameters on the stability of
an aircraft at transonic
speeds .

of cropped delta planform and 6( symmetrical section
at stream mach numbers between 0. 8 and 1. 41 .
  a study has been made of the flow development
over the wing as the incidence and stream
mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure
distributions and oil-flow patterns .  the growth
and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and
forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for
flow separation through these shocks are considered .  for
the rear shock, which has little sweep, these
conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation
on two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward
shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems
to correspond to two rather different but
simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the
component mach number normal to the shock front
and the other to the position of the reattachment line .
  the flow in the region between the leading edge and
the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics
analogous to those found upstream of the shock on
two-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward
shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low
supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about
a simple cone .
  the general flow development is related in the
text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag .
the first two are most affected by the aft movement
of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic
drag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be
influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation
and possibly also by some stage in the development
of the forward shock .
  the flow over the cropped-delta planform is
noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock
and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and
partly to the unswept trailing edge .  a comparison is made
with results obtained during preliminary tests in
which the wing planform closely resembled that of a true
delta .

  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-

  this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence
relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by
transonic slender-body theory .  the models chosen for this study are a
flat, winglike, elliptic cone-cylinder and its equivalent body of
revolution, a circular cone-cylinder .  it is determined that the flows
about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the
theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 0.92 to
cone-cylinder vary linearly only over the small angle-of-attack range of
approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares
favorably with jones' slender-wing theory .
  the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and
at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic
characteristics of slender, three-dimensional shapes can be made by use
of transonic slender-body theory when the pressures on the equivalent
body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate
nonlinear theory .  from transonic slender-body theory it is deduced
that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that
required for the successful application of the transonic area rule .

  an experimental investigation of the laminar, transitional, and

pressure gradient on the body are investigated .  the experimental
results are compared with the theories available in the literature .
  the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare
configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion
smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body
and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .
  the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over
a range of reynolds number from 0.3 x 10 to 1.6 x 10 per inch
based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to
the test with liquid nitrogen .  the stagnation-to-wall
temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .
  the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat
transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the
transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder
and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion
of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only

very rapidly .  by making a smooth transition between the

diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .
  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected

were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the

wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing
interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal
force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local
flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are
discussed and analyzed .
  comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and
center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with
theories which include methods for estimating the effects of
viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly
dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack .
further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and
experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that,
in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing
theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and
distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .
  the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the
circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body
vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter
integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet .
the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in
close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength
formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is
assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical
portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible
potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of
equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however,
in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex
locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined
from experiment .
  the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are,
in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned
incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination
angles which are in good agreement with the measured values,
except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet,
and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are
expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple
methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to
substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and
experiment .

adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions
represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the

numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large
number of parameters appearing in the problem .  of these, the
gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly
important .  it is found that at low gap moderate body
distortions have a significant influence on the drag .  drag reductions
of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been
found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a
gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,
and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body .
comparison is made with the conventional wing-body
combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not
appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the
configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower
than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations .
  tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a
scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile
wing .  the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number
was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length .  it was found that the
measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the
body agrees very well with the theoretical value .  downstream
of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was
observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock
but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the
body of the shock-induced cross flow .  further observations
suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body
or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the
shock-induced cross flow .

  this paper is a brief summary of

on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic

combined with the theory of whitham to
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies
and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as
general, method was derived by walkden in
ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the
volume term, has been used extensively to predict
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,
been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.
altitude and the calculations of this paper show
that under those conditions the shock noise of
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,
be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will
dominate for even the small fighter and they will
dominate over most of the altitude range
for large bomber and supersonic transport
aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases
with altitude as which compares to
in the volume case (=pressure at
altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,
wing loading, wing plan shape and
lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating
the shock noise due to combined volume and
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to
configurations with wings located towards the
rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting
volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is
presented from which rapid estimates can be

in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

",739,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most
applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several
approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of
these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the
assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .
another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the
shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .
recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .
numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these
conditions of load have also been obtained (4) .  an examination
of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending
stresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the
meridional bending moment .

an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,
and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several
limitations on such streams .
in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force
liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure
gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in
the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same
boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which
agrees closely with machine calculations .
in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due
 to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be
negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are
separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature
variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional
heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the
constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for
free-convection flows/ considered by many authors .
finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise
variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the
independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise
velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the
channel, a solution is given .

an investigation at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 in a blowdown type

zero angle of attack wing surface when certain exhaust parameters of a
hot turbojet engine are varied . static-pressure surveys were made on a
wing surface that was located in the vicinity of a small-scale

exhausts . these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a
 cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two
 cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/ . the hot jet, because of its
high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was
performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust
parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine . the cold jets
used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the
exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific
heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold
jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet . the tests were made over

  the creep of a slightly crooked section column carrying a
constant load is studied theoretically .  the material of the
column is characterized by a strain-time relationship, under
constant uniaxial stress, of the form, where is
the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b,
and k are material constants .  this form was selected because it
applies to at least two alloys--75s-t6 aluminum alloy at 600 f .
and a low-alloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f .  however, the
analysis is intended for any material having creep properties of the
same form and for which the material constants are known .  a
strain-time relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary
for the column analysis, is formulated from the constant-stress
properties with the aid of shanley's engineering hypotheses of
creep .
  the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection
approaches infinity--that is, the column collapses--in finite time .
results are given showing the maximum length of time the
column can support a given load before it collapses and the growth
of stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse .

  the general dynamic equation of
creep bending of a beam loaded
laterally and axially was derived for a
linearly viscoelastic material whose
mechanical properties can be characterized
by four parameters .  the
material can exhibit instantaneous and retarded
elasticity as well as pure
flow .
  the equation derived was used to
obtain the creep bending deflection
of a beam in pure bending and of a column
with initial sinusoidal
deviation from straightness .  as expected, the
ratio of the creep deflections
of the beam in pure bending and the
deflections of a corresponding purely
elastic structure is identical to the
ratio of the creep strain and the
corresponding elastic strain of a bar
under simple tension or compression .
  the results of the analysis of the
creep deflection of the column
showed that the deflections increase
continuously with time and become
infinitely large only when the loading
time is correspondingly large .
however, large deflections are obtained
in reasonably short periods of
time if the applied load is near to the
euler load of the column .  the
deflection-time curves obtained from a
numerical example are of the same
type as those determined by experiment
with aluminum columns .

it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for
the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial
imperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by
which failure due to creep occurs after a period of time .  in fact,
it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfect
column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical
load will not buckle at all .  this is an interesting contrast to the
case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an
insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect
column is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfect

for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to

  this paper develops a new method for determining the buckling

the paper deals with the general equations for the vibration of thin

many of their higher frequencies associated with the simpler modes of

  a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of
sandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory
of homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are
important in the present problem, which have not been considered
previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of
transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress
deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of
importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was
found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no
counterpart in flat-plate theory .
  the general results of this report have been applied to the
solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular
cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical
examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects
of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .
  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of
taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type
shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between
the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the
composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse
shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to
be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse
core flexibility .
  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the
geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration
so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic
modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .

obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed
in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse
shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does
not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .

  the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled
circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered .
it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure
has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics .
for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to
diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency
is in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number of
circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated
with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p .
if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p
when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest
frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal
pressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequency
spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the
frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential
nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal

",826,"small bending and stretching of sandwich type shells .
  a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of
sandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory
of homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are
important in the present problem, which have not been considered
previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of
transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress
deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of
importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was
found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no
counterpart in flat-plate theory .
  the general results of this report have been applied to the
solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular
cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical
examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects
of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .
  the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of
taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type
shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between
the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the
composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse
shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to
be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse
core flexibility .
  the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the
geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration
so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic
modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .
  solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be
obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed
in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse
shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does
not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .

",827,"a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin
elastic shallow spherical shells .
  a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure
for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at
relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one
for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in
the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for
structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question
arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the
classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to
infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy
criterion/ proposed by tsien .
  in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling
of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and
experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations
are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of
the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the
coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome
is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its
thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge
rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load
according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t,
convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the
buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however
even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined
for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs .
these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t
increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied,
the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .
  experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion
of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the
theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for
higher domes is also indicated .

",1134,"torispherical shells - a caution to designers .
  it has recently become apparent, through
a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case
that designing torispherical shells by the
current edition of the asme code on unfired
pressure vessels can lead to failure during
proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose
of the present paper is to show in what
respects the code fails to give accurate results .
as an illustrative example, a hypothetical
pressure vessel with a torispherical head
having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was
selected .  the supports of the vessel were
considered to be either on the main cylinder
or around the torus .  the vessel was
subjected to internal pressure and the elastic
stresses in it were determined rigorously and
by the code .  a comparison of the two
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the
head which were less than one half of those
actually occurring .  furthermore, the code
gave no indication of the presence of high
compressive circumferential direct stresses
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically
the entire torus .  if the head had been
fabricated using a steel with a yield point of
would have failed or undergone large
deformations, whereas the code would have
predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules
for torispherical heads are thus in need of
revision for certain geometries .  the
implications of the foregoing results are currently
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,
however, designers should exercise care in
applying the code to torispherical shells .
  it is also shown in the paper that the use
of the membrane state as a particular
solution of the differential equations is not a
good approximation for toroidal shells of the
type considered .

of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain
of intermediate problems, which can be
solved explicitly and in finite form in terms
of the membrane problem .  in the
intermediate problems, the deflection converges
uniformly in the domain of the plate
of the clamped plate, and the derivatives
of all orders of the deflection converge
uniformly in every domain completely interior
to the plate .  (in the ritz method, not even

  a short discussion is given of the possible methods for
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local
loadings .  it is concluded that the method of developing
the loads and displacements into double fourier series
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical
evaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressions
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by
reducing the three partial differential equations of the
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical
with, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of the
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external
loading in this equation leads directly to a double series
expression of the radial displacement w in terms of the load
factors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent
expressions for the other displacements and for the
bending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to
it are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,
tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the
circumferential direction, (d) a moment in the
circumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short
distance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these
loadings the load factors, which have to be used in the
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending
moments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential
equation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the
tangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the
displacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for
tangential loading within a rectangle are found .

",928,"a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under
axial compression and bending .
  the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical
shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and
too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good
agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the
assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal
deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6
to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently
considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens
than for duralumin and increases with the radius-
thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between
observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .
  in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is
developed, which permits initial eccentricities or
deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true
instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,.
the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is
assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum
stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial
eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for
the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial
eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,.
however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be
explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are
assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and
if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the
magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with
these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a
function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of
elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this
a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves
relations suggested by the theory but is based on
experimental data .
  it is shown that similar discrepancies between
experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin
cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the
same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can
be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation
buckling problems can probably be explained by similar
considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may
help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems .
the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should
be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other
applications as well .
  the paper presents the results of about a hundred new
tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending,
which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form
the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .

of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most

assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .

violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .

case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .

of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending

a value near atmospheric pressure during the tests, so that the reynolds

tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determine
the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary

having adverse pressure gradients .  the magnitude of the gradients
relative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the
gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of
curvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at the
beginning of the gradient .  the overall pressure rise in most cases was
greater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layer
to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave .
an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of
the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of
cases outside the range of the experiments .
it is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predicted
from the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measured
values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with
values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional
methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow .  a new
procedure for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in this

and calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adverse
pressure gradients created by curved surfaces .  this procedure is based
on the experimental observation that the station at which high-energy

number of parameters appearing in the problem .  of these, the
gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly
important .  it is found that at low gap moderate body
distortions have a significant influence on the drag .  drag reductions
of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been
found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a
gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body,
and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body .
comparison is made with the conventional wing-body
combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that
the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not
appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the
configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower
than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations .
  tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a
scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile
wing .  the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number
was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length .  it was found that the
measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the
body agrees very well with the theoretical value .  downstream
of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was
observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the
separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock
but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the
body of the shock-induced cross flow .  further observations
suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body
or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the
shock-induced cross flow .

compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

",1134,"torispherical shells - a caution to designers .
  it has recently become apparent, through
a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case
that designing torispherical shells by the
current edition of the asme code on unfired
pressure vessels can lead to failure during
proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose
of the present paper is to show in what
respects the code fails to give accurate results .
as an illustrative example, a hypothetical
pressure vessel with a torispherical head
having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was
selected .  the supports of the vessel were
considered to be either on the main cylinder
or around the torus .  the vessel was
subjected to internal pressure and the elastic
stresses in it were determined rigorously and
by the code .  a comparison of the two
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the
head which were less than one half of those
actually occurring .  furthermore, the code
gave no indication of the presence of high
compressive circumferential direct stresses
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically
the entire torus .  if the head had been
fabricated using a steel with a yield point of
would have failed or undergone large
deformations, whereas the code would have
predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules
for torispherical heads are thus in need of
revision for certain geometries .  the
implications of the foregoing results are currently
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,
however, designers should exercise care in
applying the code to torispherical shells .
  it is also shown in the paper that the use
of the membrane state as a particular
solution of the differential equations is not a
good approximation for toroidal shells of the
type considered .

",1172,"elastic stability of circular cylindrical shells stabilized

  the effect of a soft elastic core upon the
buckling strength of a thin, circular, cylindrical shell is
investigated experimentally .  two types of loading are
considered ..  (a) axial compression, and (b) uniform
radial-band loading, where the width of the band is small
compared to the length of the shell .
  for each type of loading it is shown that the
strengthening effect of the elastic core becomes more significant
with the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio .
for example, it is shown that for the geometric and
elastic constants considered it is possible, with the presence
of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as
much as 65 percent over the values found for those
without an elastic core .  the elastic core is even more
effective in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to band
loading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filled
specimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle the
unfilled shell .

approximately 65 scientists in this field from 14 countries .  this

such relatively new topics as the buckling of bimetallic shells,
pressurized shells, creep buckling, and dynamic buckling, as well as
in the more traditional problems involving isotropic shells of various

  experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer
rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully
separated wakes are presented .  the afterbodies are generally
similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end
of the forebody .
  tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a
range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical

models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft.

which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or

interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat
wider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are
presented and compared with each other in terms of
nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the
forebody .
  the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be
roughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody,
the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody
end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or
reynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds
number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained
from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and
some quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number
range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit
boundary layers were considered to be laminar .  an approximate
check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present
tests also indicates a laminar rate .  no information was obtained
concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated
boundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient
on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was
observed .
  heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an

direction is noted .  the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies
with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end)
roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) .
  heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost
twice the values on the sides .  the heat rates on the large-step
body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .
  in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion
angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing
test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach
number square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the
effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually
constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody
heat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the
afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the
stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on
this body .

the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and
resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on
the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with
which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the
divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of
secondary importance compared to those associated with the
curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface .  it is
shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as

surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn,
may be related to the geometry of the surface .

are inadequate except over very limited ranges of fineness ratio

consistently good results throughout the supersonic speed range .

so that the effects of boundary-layer growth, shock

of stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an
number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same
wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds
number is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of
viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the
general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical
significance is carefully discussed .
  the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called
neutral curve for the two characteristic types of
velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and
the symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the
neutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between
profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two
branches of the neutral curve approach and for
profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile
without a flex .  the most important results are as follows .
for sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always
exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a
similar result was obtained by synge from energy
considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the
motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the
asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further
that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond
which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence
the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .
  the author proceeds to show that simple approximate
expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his
general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these
approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius
flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds
numbers are based on the width of the channel and the
displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method
for computing the complete instability curve is presented
and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked
out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been
given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more
exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far

viscous flows with nonzero surface velocities is formulated and is
shown to be identical to that for conventional boundary layers,
with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbers
required .  specific consideration is given to the wall boundary
layer behind a moving shock wave, and the minimum critical
reynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities .
the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of a

monotonically with shock velocity--i.e., with increasing surface
cooling and stream mach number combined .  for the ratio of
wall to stream velocity of 2.92 with (shock mach number
of 2.18) the flow is found to be infinitely stable to two-dimensional
disturbances .

over a curved surface .
  the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for
surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer
flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .
  the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated
by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the
generalized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is
applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation
in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer
equations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the
boundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple
transformation, the governing differential equation can be
expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation
for zero surface curvature .
  numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a
flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient
have been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer
and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex
surfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall
is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on
the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop
below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to
reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase
again .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a
different method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results
with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic
differences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular,
murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex
surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall

stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady
compressible flow .
  a method is developed for the
calculation of the pressure
distribution and the aerodynamic forces and
moments on a wing performing harmonic
pitching and heaving oscillations .
the calculation is based on the
assumption of inviscid potential flow
without shock waves and is
restricted to small incidence, so that the
linearized theory is valid .
  in contrast to other work in the
field the theory applies to all
mach numbers .  it is restricted to small
values of the reduced frequency
and should be valid for the usual range
of short periods occurring at
present in flight .  the formal solution
yields two integral equations for
the parts of the load, which are in phase
and go out of phase with the
oscillation,. these are of the same form
as the corresponding equation
in steady flow .
  the way is thus opened for solutions
over the whole mach number
range at small frequencies, if the
corresponding steady solutions can
be found .  the calculation is in fact
easiest for m = 1 and has been
done here for delta-wings to supplement
a previous supersonic calculation,
made on different frequency assumptions,
which broke down near m = 1 .
it appears from the two sets of results
that the short period oscillation
will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex
angle of the delta wing is
greater than about 60 .  this confirms a
now generally recognised trend .
  such results near m = 1 must of
course be invalidated to an
unknown extent by thickness viscosity and
shock waves at their maximum
effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that
these factors will remove
the critical nature of the transonic damping
as calculated by this method .
with all its obvious limitations this method,
when extended to other
planforms, should provide a useful tool in

  considerable interest is currently centered on the
role of deformation and flow types of plasticity
theories in the solution of stability problems .  for
thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with
classical stability theory appears to yield results which
are in substantially good agreement with test data .
on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear
to require the introduction of initial imperfections in
order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with
tests .
  thus, in view of the current state of development of
plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit
the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation
theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of
thin shells .  although there may be theoretical
objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on
flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results
obtained from this theory .

  this paper studies the steady
motion of an electrically conducting, viscous fluid
along channels in the presence of an imposed
transverse magnetic field when the walls do not
conduct currents .  the equations which determine
the velocity profile, induced currents and
field are derived and solved exactly in the case
of a rectangular channel .  when the imposed
field is sufficiently strong the velocity profile is
found to degenerate into a core of uniform flow
surrounded by boundary layers on each wall .
the layers on the walls parallel to the imposed
field are of a novel character .  an analogous
degenerate solution for channels of any symmetrical
shape is developed .  the predicted pressure
gradients for given volumes of flow at various field
strengths are finally compared with experimental results for square and
circular pipes .

in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant
temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .

effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces .
an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties,
and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several
limitations on such streams .
in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force
liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure
gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in
the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same
boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which
agrees closely with machine calculations .
in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large
temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due
 to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be
negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are
separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature
variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional
heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the
constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for
free-convection flows/ considered by many authors .
finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise
variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the
independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise
velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the
channel, a solution is given .

  the problem is considered of calculating approximately the
inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a
smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing
edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the
assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for
the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic
shock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary
characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple
shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing
the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances
it may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic
variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then
formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock
shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the
special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is,
for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape
expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result
previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender
bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by
friedrichs .
  employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion
method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent
perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent
flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers
of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an
oblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those
regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to
taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected
in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and
reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary
conditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for
the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure
distribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals
involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the
method of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its
accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure
distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at
an infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are

shown a progressive-type stall at low speeds . the amplitude
of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first
few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the
latter stages . a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating
stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low
speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with
compressor surge at high speeds .
     blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by
rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage
compressors .
      in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage
performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages
was considered . in general, the pressure drop at the stall point
is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical
formulation of compressor performance . compressor surge is
attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall
point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in
jet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may
result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic
characteristics of compressor surge . in this event, engine operation
will be limited because of the large drop in performance which
accompanies compressor stall  .

the tendency in the past has been to assume that
when wakes or non-uniform total head profiles are
fed into an axial compressor then substantially constant
static pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in total
head appearing as variations in velocity .  this variation
in velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stage
blade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of blade
vibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, in
references 1 and 2, but we think has been a common
assumption by most of the people working in this field .
  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantially
parallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such an
assumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when given
an air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,
to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then the
distribution assumed would normally be obtained and in fact
many surveys of such ducts have been represented in this
fashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,
this distribution will not normally occur when the
compressor is present and we may normally expect much more
nearly a constant velocity into the compressor with
attendant static pressure distributions to match with the total
head variations ahead of the intake, with of course, the

  the three-dimensional incompressible flow of fluid along the corner of
two semi-infinite plates intersecting at right angles, especially the
interference of the boundary layers of the two plates, is discussed .
mainly, the more important case of turbulent boundary layer is treated
by means of experimental studies carried out at the technical university
of braunschweig .  some theoretical results for laminar flow are also
taken into account .
  in order to describe the interference effects in the boundary layer,
an interference displacement thickness and an interference skin friction
have been introduced .  it is shown from experiments and also from
theoretical considerations how these two quantities depend on reynolds
number .  furthermore, the influence of interference on the transition
from laminar to turbulent flow is investigated .  in addition, some
preliminary results are given about the effect of the pressure gradient
on the interference effects .

exhausts . these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a
 cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two
 cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/ . the hot jet, because of its
high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was
performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust
parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine . the cold jets
used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the
exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific
heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold
jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet . the tests were made over

  the mixing and divergence of a supersonic jet exhausting into

  in the first part of this paper, the flow is assumed to be laminar .
when the velocity and temperature in the jet are different
slightly from those of the surrounding stream, by the method of
small perturbations and under ordinary boundary layer
assumptions, the equation of motion of two-dimensional flow will be
reduced to a form of the well-known equation of heat conduction,
whose solution is known for any given boundary conditions .  it
has also been shown that the exact solution of the two
dimensional jet mixing of viscous compressible fluids can be obtained
by successive approximations starting with the solution of small

  velocity and temperature distributions for two cases--one is
the mixing of two-uniform flows and the other is the mixing of a
jet of compressible fluid from a two-dimensional nozzle with full
expansion exhausting into a supersonic stream--have been
calculated .  the properties of the jet mixing depend mainly on the
momentum of the jet regardless of whether the change of
momentum is due to the change of velocity or the change of
temperature--i.e., the change of density .  compressibility has a
considerable effect on the properties of the jet .
  in the second part, the cases of turbulent flow are investigated .

shearing stress may be expressed as

where is a constant that can be determined experimentally .
the value of n lies between 0 and 1 .  the exact value of n

the equation of two-dimensional turbulent jet mixing is identical
to that of the laminar case .  hence, the solution of the first part

",811,"an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity
of sonic booms .
  this paper is a brief summary of
an investigation made to check the effect of lift
on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic
speeds .  the method of hayes has been
combined with the theory of whitham to
predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings
carrying lift and of combinations of bodies
and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as
general, method was derived by walkden in
ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the
volume term, has been used extensively to predict
the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies
and the agreement with experiment has, so far,
been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained
to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft.
altitude and the calculations of this paper show
that under those conditions the shock noise of
the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases,
be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown
that at higher altitudes lifting effects will
dominate for even the small fighter and they will
dominate over most of the altitude range
for large bomber and supersonic transport
aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases
with altitude as which compares to
in the volume case (=pressure at
altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number,
wing loading, wing plan shape and
lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating
the shock noise due to combined volume and
lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to
configurations with wings located towards the
rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock
noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal
to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift)
or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting
volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is
presented from which rapid estimates can be
made of the shock noise of lifting
wing-body combinations .

measured .  measurements near the ground track for flights of a
supersonic fighter and one flight of a supersonic bomber are
presented .
  level cruising flight at an altitude of 60,000 feet and a mach
number of 2.0 produced sonic booms which were considered to be
tolerable, and it is reasonable to expect that cruising flight at higher
altitudes will produce booms of tolerable intensity for airplanes of the
size and weight of the test airplanes .  the measured variation of
sonic-boom intensity with altitude was in good agreement with the
variation calculated by an equation given in nasa technical note d-48 .
  the effect of mach number on the ground overpressure is small between
mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.0, a result in agreement with the theory .  no
amplification of the shock-wave overpressures due to refraction effects
was apparent near the cutoff mach number .
  a method for estimating the effect of flight-path angle on cutoff
mach number is shown .  experimental results indicate agreement with the
method, since a climb maneuver produced booms of a much decreased
intensity as compared with the intensity of those measured in level flight at
about the same altitude and mach number .

",739,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

 uncoupled vibration modes although coupled modes can be used . the
aerodynamic loadings are based on distributions of section lift-curve

the /effective/ angle-of-attack distribution resulting from each of the

 of varying sweep angle, aspect ratio, taper ratio, and center-
of-gravity position at mach numbers from 0 to as high as 1.75 . comparisons

  a short discussion is given of the possible methods for
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local
loadings .  it is concluded that the method of developing
the loads and displacements into double fourier series
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical
evaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressions
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by
reducing the three partial differential equations of the
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical
with, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of the
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external
loading in this equation leads directly to a double series
expression of the radial displacement w in terms of the load
factors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent
expressions for the other displacements and for the
bending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to
it are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,
tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the
circumferential direction, (d) a moment in the
circumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short
distance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these
loadings the load factors, which have to be used in the
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending
moments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential
equation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the
tangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the
displacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for
tangential loading within a rectangle are found .

of the equilibrium of a membrane by a chain
of intermediate problems, which can be

of all orders of the deflection converge
uniformly in every domain completely interior

  reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design

divide the web into panels, it is required to find the
buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by
spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners .

compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

",14,"piston theory - a new aerodynamic tool for the
aeroelastician .
  representative applications are described which illustrate the
extent to which simplifications in the solutions of high-speed
unsteady aeroelastic problems can be achieved through the use of
certain aerodynamic techniques known collectively as /piston
theory ./  based on a physical model originally proposed by
hayes and lighthill, piston theory for airfoils and finite wings
has been systematically developed by landahl, utilizing
expansions in powers of the thickness ratio and the inverse of the
flight mach number m .  when contributions of orders and
are negligible, the theory predicts a point-function
relationship between the local pressure on the surface of a wing and the
normal component of fluid velocity produced by the wing's
motion .  the computation of generalized forces in aeroelastic
equations, such as the flutter determinant, is then always
reduced to elementary integrations of the assumed modes of motion .
  essentially closed-form solutions are given for the bending-
torsion and control-surface flutter properties of typical section
airfoils at high mach numbers .  these agree well with results of
more exact theories wherever comparisons can be fairly made .
moreover, they demonstrate the increasingly important influence
of thickness and profile shape as m grows larger, a discovery that
would be almost impossible using other available aerodynamic
tools .  the complexity of more practical flutter analyses-e.g., on
three-dimensional wings and panels-is shown to be substantially
reduced by piston theory .  an iterative procedure is outlined, by
which improved flutter eigenvalues can be found through the
successive introduction of higher-order terms in and  .
  other applications to unsteady supersonic problems are
reviewed, including gust response and rapid maneuvers of elastic
aircraft .  steady-state aeroelastic calculations are also discussed,
but for them piston theory amounts only to a slight modification
of ackeret's formulas .
  suggestions are made regarding future research based on the
new aerodynamic method, with particular emphasis on areas where
computational labor can be reduced with a minimum loss of
precision .  it is pointed out that a mach number zone exists where
thermal effects are appreciable but nonlinear viscous interactions
may be neglected, and that in this zone piston theory is the logical
way of estimating air loads when analyzing aerodynamic-
thermoelastic interaction problems .

critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under

compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing

value is appreciably too high and that the form of distortion
which occurs in practice differs from that assumed in theory .
  in recent years much work has been done on this problem

considerably smaller than that previously predicted by theory .

keep a thin cylindrical shell in a buckled condition is about one-third
of that given by southwell, a result in very fair
agreement with experiment, and that once the cylinder has buckled,

",739,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

  the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are
of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most
applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner
and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several
approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of
these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the
assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the
shell remain conical after deformation and also that the
extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish .
another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the
shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of
the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter
violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges .
recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special
case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading .

of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are
of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending

",1134,"torispherical shells - a caution to designers .
  it has recently become apparent, through
a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case
that designing torispherical shells by the
current edition of the asme code on unfired
pressure vessels can lead to failure during
proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose
of the present paper is to show in what
respects the code fails to give accurate results .
as an illustrative example, a hypothetical
pressure vessel with a torispherical head
having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was
selected .  the supports of the vessel were
considered to be either on the main cylinder
or around the torus .  the vessel was
subjected to internal pressure and the elastic
stresses in it were determined rigorously and
by the code .  a comparison of the two
revealed that the code predicted stresses in the
head which were less than one half of those
actually occurring .  furthermore, the code
gave no indication of the presence of high
compressive circumferential direct stresses
which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically
the entire torus .  if the head had been
fabricated using a steel with a yield point of
would have failed or undergone large
deformations, whereas the code would have
predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules
for torispherical heads are thus in need of
revision for certain geometries .  the
implications of the foregoing results are currently
being studied by the asme,. in the interim,
however, designers should exercise care in
applying the code to torispherical shells .
  it is also shown in the paper that the use
of the membrane state as a particular
solution of the differential equations is not a
good approximation for toroidal shells of the
type considered .

shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to find
the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find
critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under
other loading conditions .  it is shown that by this method
solutions may be obtained very easily and the results in each case may
be expressed in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one
dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially
determined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of boundary

and with test results .  the solutions to a number of problems

equivalent to donnell's equation but has certain advantages in physical
interpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the case
of shells having clamped edges .  the solution of this modified

  to help fill the gap in the knowledge

  the results of this investigation
indicate that there are distinct
aerodynamic advantages to the use of
elliptic cones .  with their major
cross-sectional axes horizontal, they
develop greater lift and have higher
lift-drag ratios than circular cones
of the same fineness ratio and volume .
in combination with triangular wings

higher lift-drag ratios than circular
cones with the same wings .  for
winged elliptic cones, this increase
in lift-drag ratio results both from
lower zero-lift drag and drag due to
lift .  visual-flow studies indicate
that, because of better streamlining
in the crossflow plane, vortex flow
is inhibited more for an elliptic cone

wing than for a circular cone with the

drag resulting from lift is reduced .
shifts in center of pressure with
changes in angle of attack and mach

independence principle .  according to this principle, the

 have a small damping to avoid tollmien-schlichting type of instability

detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those
encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances
have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions
which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous
solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the
compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first
approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is
greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic
values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and
the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the

coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the
ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .

that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient
of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface
has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .

corridors of certain planets can be broadened
markedly by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for

",798,"interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the
effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes .
the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important
effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been
written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical
review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying
physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to
the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our
knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a
fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem
is understood sufficiently well for design purposes .
part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types
of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the
 development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction
 depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of
the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a
laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if
the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of
the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences
it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the
difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers
arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in
an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream
 of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the
separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the
surface .
many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in
 practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of
the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of
aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the
interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and
in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences
between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are
often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and
full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore,
frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial
means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of
the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that
experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a
number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and
connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the
turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight
 and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a
certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions
full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if
the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and
the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information
 is at present available on this point .
most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion
characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated
reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this
is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation
 between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge
remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock
 waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain
 unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface
separation .
some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the
occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other
respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce .

of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as

the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is applied to find
critical stresses for cylinders with simply supported edges under
other loading conditions .  it is shown that by this method
solutions may be obtained very easily and the results in each case may

dependent on the critical stress and the other essentially

and with test results .  the solutions to a number of problems

interpretation and in ease of solution, particularly in the case

shells .
  the purpose of the present paper is to derive a system of
equations which can be used for the analysis of shallow segments of
thin, elastic, spherical shells .  a segment will be called shallow if
the ratio of its height to base diameter is less than, say .  the
results obtained on the basis of this assumption will often also be
applicable to shells which are not shallow, namely then, when the loads
are such that the stresses are effectively restricted to shallow zones .
  the problem of the spherical elastic shell has been the subject of
numerous researches .  for the rotationally symmetric case the

point of many applications .  while it is possible to deduce from these

may be of some interest even for rotationally symmetric cases .

",739,"the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial
compression .
in two previous papers the authors have discussed
in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of
thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of
cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that
not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times
higher than that found by experiments, but the
observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different
from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed
out that the different explanations for this discrepancy
advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are
untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these
explanations are compared with the experimental facts .
by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the
authors were led to the belief that in general the
buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be
explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory .
this point of view was substantiated by model
experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic
support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures
cause the load necessary to keep the shell in
equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave
amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first
of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is
released once the buckling has started,. this explains
the observed rapidity of the buckling process .
furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers
the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by
slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations
during the testing process .
  in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case
of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial
compression .  first it is shown by an approximate
calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops
with increasing deflection .  then the results of this
calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of
the buckling process as observed in an actual testing
machine .

arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the

network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships

deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of

direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many
times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the
transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly

found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison
with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a
flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows
that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this
similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution
is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a
hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel
indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface
pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity
theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .
  energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the
equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for
a class of bodies of the form, provided that,
where for a two-dimensional body and for a
body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not

",1225,"the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of
turbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams .
tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.0 to 3.5 to determine
the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary
layers on two-dimensional and axisymmetric curved-surface models
having adverse pressure gradients .  the magnitude of the gradients
relative to the boundary-layer thickness at the beginning of the
gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of
curvature and by changing the boundary-layer thickness at the
beginning of the gradient .  the overall pressure rise in most cases was
greater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layer
to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave .
an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of
the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of
cases outside the range of the experiments .
it is shown that boundary-layer momentum thickness can be predicted
from the von karman boundary-layer momentum equation, but that measured
values of boundary-layer profile shape are in poor agreement with
values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional
methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow .  a new
procedure for calculating boundary-layer profile shapes, developed in this
paper, is shown to provide a good correlation between experimental
and calculated values of boundary-layer profile shapes in adverse
pressure gradients created by curved surfaces .  this procedure is based
on the experimental observation that the station at which high-energy
free-stream flow actually mixes into a turbulent boundary layer in
an adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station at
which flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flat-plate profile .

vortices .
  results of an experimental investigation of instability leading
to transition in the subsonic boundary layer flow along a flat
plate are presented .  a series of wings was placed outside the
boundary layer to produce streamwise vortices, which in turn
made the boundary layer three-dimensional--i.e., periodic in
thickness in the spanwise direction .  hot-wire measurements
were made to trace the downstream development of the
disturbance or wave created by the vibrating ribbon .  as the wave
travels downstream, it is deformed into a three-dimensional
configuration by the three-dimensionality of the boundary-layer
flow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small in
intensity .  it is only after the wave intensity exceeds a certain
amount (which depends on the degree of boundary-layer
three-dimensionality) that the nonlinear effect manifests itself by the
rapid amplification of wave intensity, the rapid increase in wave
three-dimensionality, and the distortion in mean velocity profile .
the appearance of nonlinear development inevitably leads to the
breakdown of laminar flow, and hence the onset of turbulence .
there is present a mechanism by which the energy is transferred
from one spanwise position to another so that the breakdown of
laminar flow occurs as a consequence of three-dimensional
development of the wave as a whole .

represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the

calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of
downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and
cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of
such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and

vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total

in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow
past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec .
thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near
equilibrium for transport properties and of large
departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .
  following a survey of the equilibrium statistical
thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a
new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is
characterized by only three constants, the characteristic
temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation .
physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational
modes always just half excited (so that at low
temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather
then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas
are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations
deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an
elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any
bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations
are given for the isentropic changes that take place along
streamlines between shocks .
  various of these results are applied to the problem
typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the
newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification
are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the
limit for large values of both mach number and density
ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero
surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory
corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock
wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the
subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another
approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation
streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational
in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a
spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body .
the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that
predicted by freeman's second approximation based on

the equations of motion for the flow of an ideal dissociating gas
through a nearly conical nozzle have been solved numerically, assuming

calculations suggest that deviations from dissociation equilibrium will
occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range
of values . they also suggest that once such a deviation has begun the
gas will very rapidly/freeze/, so that the dissociation fraction will
remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it
passes through a constant area test section . an approximate method
of solution, making use of this property of sudden/freezing/of the flow,
 has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the
deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if all
the assumptions made in this report are accepted, then lack of
dissociation equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of
hypersonic wind tunnels and hypersonic shock tubes .
it is shown, however, that the flow behind a normal shock wave in such a
 wind tunnel will not be greatly affected by any freezing that may take
place in the nozzle upstream of the shock wave . even so, the stand-off
distance of a shock wave in front of a blunt model may be quite
sensitive to deviations from equilibrium .

the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well
known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a
great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane .
aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one
component of the grand compromise that a completed
airplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag
ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind
tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft
have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true
that the requirements of stability and control, structure,
and flight operation all contribute to reducing the
design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values
which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic
theory .  if, however, a certain range or operating
efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum
if we examine the range equation we see that range is
proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive
efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final
weight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a
linear factor in the range equation indicates that every
attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however,
the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange
and unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such
configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of
their geometry on the weight ratios .  in the present
paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio
problem for conventional configurations having a wing
and a body in close proximity to each other .  no attempt
will be made to select a particular configuration
as being the best .  however, the promising direction

",77,"a comparative analysis of the performance of long range
hypervelocity vehicles .
  long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their
motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in
unpowered flight .  powered flight is
analyzed for an idealized propulsion
system which rather closely approaches
present-day rocket motors .
unpowered flight is characterized by a return
to earth along a ballistic, skip,
or glide trajectory .  only those
trajectories are treated which yield the
maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight .
aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner
similar to that employed previously
by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047),
with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is
considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .
  the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the
several types studied in the sense
that it generally requires the highest
velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range .
this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat
transfer to the re-entry body through
the artifice of increasing pressure
drag in relation to friction drag - that
is, by using a blunt body .  thus
the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight
may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .
  the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood
of and greater than 4 is far superior
to the ballistic vehicle in ability
to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far
more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage
that this heat can in the main be radiated
back to the atmosphere .
consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .
  the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is
found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in
converting velocity into range .  at
lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to
be about equal to comparable ballistic
vehicles while at lift-drag ratios

",225,"elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds .
  to help fill the gap in the knowledge
of aerodynamics of shapes
intermediate between bodies of revolution
and flat triangular wings, force
and moment characteristics for elliptic
cones have been experimentally
determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and
sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6
and with lengths and base areas
equal to circular cones of fineness
ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied
for angles of bank of 0 and 90 .
elliptic and circular cones in
combination with triangular wings of aspect
ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been
considered .  the angle-of-attack range
was from 0 to about 16, and the
reynolds number was 8x10, based on
model length .  in addition to the
forces and moments at angle of attack,
pressure distributions for elliptic
cones at zero angle of attack have been determined .
  the results of this investigation
indicate that there are distinct
aerodynamic advantages to the use of
elliptic cones .  with their major
cross-sectional axes horizontal, they
develop greater lift and have higher
lift-drag ratios than circular cones
of the same fineness ratio and volume .
in combination with triangular wings
of low aspect ratio, they also develop
higher lift-drag ratios than circular
cones with the same wings .  for
winged elliptic cones, this increase
in lift-drag ratio results both from
lower zero-lift drag and drag due to
lift .  visual-flow studies indicate
that, because of better streamlining
in the crossflow plane, vortex flow
is inhibited more for an elliptic cone
with major axis in the plane of the
wing than for a circular cone with the
same wing .  as a result, vortex
drag resulting from lift is reduced .
shifts in center of pressure with
changes in angle of attack and mach
number are small and about the same
as for circular cones .
  comparisons of theoretical and
experimental force and moment
characteristics for elliptic cones indicate
that simple linearized (flat plate)
wing theory is generally adequate even
for relatively thick cones .
zero-lift pressure distributions and drag
can be computed using van dyke's
second-order slender-body theory .
for winged circular cones, a
modification of the slender-body theory of
naca rep. 962 results in good agreement
of theory with experiment .
